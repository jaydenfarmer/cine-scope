# MovieMatch

MovieMatch is a modern Angular web app for discovering trending, popular, and free-to-watch movies and TV shows using the TMDB API. It features responsive design, animated skeleton loading cards, category filtering, and seamless mobile navigation for an engaging user experience.

## Features

- üî• **Trending, Popular, and Free-to-Watch Sections**  
  Browse movies and TV shows by what's trending, popular, or available to watch for free.

- ‚ö° **Skeleton Loading Animations**  
  Smooth skeleton cards prevent layout shift and provide instant feedback while data loads.

- üì± **Responsive & Mobile-Friendly**  
  Adaptive layouts, dropdowns, and a hamburger menu ensure a great experience on any device.

- üñºÔ∏è **Image Fallbacks**  
  If a movie, show, or person has no image, a clear fallback is shown to keep the UI consistent.

- üöÄ **Fast & Performant**  
  Uses Angular‚Äôs OnPush change detection and explicit UI updates for optimal performance.

- üõ†Ô∏è **Modular & Extensible**  
  All API logic is in a dedicated service, and UI components are reusable and easy to extend.
